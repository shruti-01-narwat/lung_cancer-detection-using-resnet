**Lung Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning**
This repository contains code and resources for detecting lung cancer using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.

**Overview**
Lung cancer is a leading cause of death globally. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. 
This project leverages machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection using medical images.

**Key Features**
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL): Utilizes ML and DL algorithms for pattern recognition and classification.
Transfer Learning (TL): Applies pre-trained models to enhance detection accuracy with limited data.
Ensemble Learning: Combines multiple models to improve overall performance.
Multiview Imaging: Integrates different imaging techniques for better diagnosis.
Image Registration and Fusion: Aligns and merges images to create a comprehensive view.
